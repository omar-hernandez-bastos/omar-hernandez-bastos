###

<p align="left">
I'm a Full Stack Developer with extensive experience in JavaScript-based technologies. Currently, I'm the Technical Leader of Online Banking where I apply my skills to develop and maintain efficient and secure online banking solutions. 

For the last two years, I have been working at Blossom, creating a banking platform from scratch for different Credit Unions in the United States. I work primarily with Node, TypeScript, GraphQL, React, and Tailwind.

Here are some of the side projects I've collaborated on without profit motives:

1. Feematic & Feematic Nest
2. Blackbeers
